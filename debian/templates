Template: joblet/grpc_server_ip
Type: string
Default:
Description: gRPC Server IP Address
 Enter the IP address where the Joblet gRPC server will listen for connections.
 This is the network interface the server will bind to.
 .
 Options:
  - 0.0.0.0 (listen on all network interfaces - recommended for most setups)
  - 192.168.1.100 (listen only on specific internal IP)
  - 127.0.0.1 (localhost only - for testing/development)
 .
 For production deployments, 0.0.0.0 is usually the best choice as it allows
 connections from any network interface while maintaining security through
 certificate-based authentication.

Template: joblet/grpc_server_port
Type: string
Default: 50051
Description: gRPC Server Port
 Enter the port number where the Joblet gRPC server will listen for connections.
 .
 Default is 50051. Make sure this port is:
  - Not already in use by another service
  - Open in your firewall if clients connect from other machines
  - Accessible to client machines that need to connect

Template: joblet/cert_primary_ip
Type: string
Default:
Description: Primary Certificate IP Address (auto-detected)
 This is the primary IP address that will be included in the SSL certificate.

 .
 Auto-detected value is usually correct for most setups. Only change if:
  - You're behind a load balancer or reverse proxy
  - Clients connect via a different IP than detected
  - You're using NAT or port forwarding

Template: joblet/cert_public_ip
Type: string
Default:
Description: Public IP Address (optional)
 If clients will connect from the internet, enter your public IP address.

 from external clients.

 Examples:
  - Cloud instance public IP: 203.0.113.100

 .
 Leave empty if all clients connect from the same local network.

Template: joblet/cert_domain
Type: string
Default:
Description: Domain Name (optional)
 If clients will connect using a domain name, enter it here.
 This will be added to the SSL certificate.
 .
 Examples:
  - api.company.com
  - joblet.mydomain.com
  - internal.company.local
 .
 Leave empty if clients only connect via IP addresses.
